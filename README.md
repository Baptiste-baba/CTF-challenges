1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. For installation instructions, refer to the installation guide below.

2. **Install project dependencies**:
   - Once node.js is installed, you also need to run these commands in your terminal to install all the project's dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install express
     ```
     ```bash
     npm install mongodb
     ```
